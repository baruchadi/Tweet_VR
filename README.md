# Tweet_VR
Get into a VR room surrounded by Tweets!  (Twitter api was not implemented in time for hackathon)

# What is it?
A hackathon project! I saw that Alienware equipment was offered, as well as VR headsets, so I decided to experiment with VR for the first time!

I never used unity before, nor have I ever used C#. 

Twitter had a representative at the hackathon and I thought that using their api would be interesting; however, I ended up having issues with their oAuth system.

This project was done in under 24 hours.

It is using placeholders for Tweets.

# How to use
WASD -> move
space -> change Tweets.

# TODO // maybe, some day, if ever?</li>
<li>Implement proper sign in to Twitter</li> 
<li>Get Tweets from Tweeter</li>
<li>Update live.</li>
<li>better design?</li>
